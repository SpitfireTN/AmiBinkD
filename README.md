AmiBinkD Source Project
Reviving and Modernizing BinkD for the Commodore Amiga
Overview
The AmiBinkD Source Project is an active effort to deliver a fully restored, modernized, and stable AmigaOS port of BinkD, the Fidonet mailer. The original Amiga port had fallen into disrepair; today, it has been rebuilt into a clean, maintainable, standards‑compliant codebase that runs natively on AmigaOS 3.x systems.
This revival is proudly driven by the Reign of Fire BBS Group —
https://www.rofbbs.com — continuing their mission to preserve the Amiga’s legacy in the Fidonet community while empowering new sysops and developers.
Current Status
AmiBinkD now includes:
• 	✔ Fully restored and reorganized source tree
• 	✔ RFC2553‑compatible networking (getaddrinfo, getnameinfo, sockaddr shims)
• 	✔ SRV record support for modern FTN hostnames
• 	✔ Complete  /  fallback for non‑POSIX toolchains
• 	✔ Amiga‑native socket handling (bsdsocket.library)
• 	✔ Clean, dependency‑free Makefile for GCC/VBCC
• 	✔ Updated tools, logging, memory management, and packet helpers
• 	✔ Builds cleanly on AmigaOS 3.x with no warnings
The foundation is now solid, and the project has moved from “recovery” to active development and refinement.
Project Goals (Updated)
• 	Maintain a stable, modern Amiga‑native BinkD implementation
• 	Improve performance and reliability on real Amiga hardware
• 	Expand compatibility with contemporary FTN mailers and hubs
• 	Provide clear documentation for building, configuring, and running AmiBinkD
• 	Encourage community contributions to keep the project evolving
• 	Preserve the Amiga’s role in Fidonet and other FTN‑based networks
Why This Matters
• 	Preservation — Ensures the Amiga remains a first‑class citizen in FTN networking
• 	Interoperability — Allows Amiga systems to communicate with modern BinkD nodes
• 	Education — Offers a clean, readable codebase for learning FTN protocols and Amiga C development
• 	Community — Supports sysops who continue to run Amiga‑based BBSes and mail hubs
• 	Legacy — Keeps the Amiga connected to the networks it helped build
Call to Action
Now that the core restoration is complete, we invite Amiga developers, sysops, and retro computing enthusiasts to help push AmiBinkD forward:
• 	Review the modernized codebase
• 	Submit optimizations, portability fixes, or new features
• 	Improve documentation and build notes
• 	Test AmiBinkD on real hardware and emulators
• 	Report bugs, edge cases, and compatibility issues
• 	Share insights into Amiga TCP/IP stacks and quirks
Every contribution strengthens the project and helps ensure AmiBinkD remains stable, teachable, and future‑proof.
