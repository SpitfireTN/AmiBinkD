# AmiBinkD Source Project
Reviving BinkD for the Commodore Amiga

## Overview
The **AmiBinkD Source Project** is dedicated to restoring and modernizing the source code of **BinkD**, the Fidonet mailer, for the **Commodore Amiga** platform. Our mission is to bring this classic port back to life so Amiga systems can once again participate in Fidonet and other FTN networks with a reliable, open-source mailer.

This project is proudly **sparked by the Reign of Fire BBS Group** — [https://www.rofbbs.com](https://www.rofbbs.com) — as part of their ongoing commitment to preserving and advancing the Amiga’s role in the Fidonet community.

## Goals
- ✅ Recover and clean up the original AmiBinkD source  
- ✅ Fix broken routines, outdated prototypes, and compatibility issues  
- ✅ Ensure stability and interoperability with current BinkD implementations  
- ✅ Document the build process for future Amiga developers and sysops  
- ✅ Preserve the retro computing legacy of the Amiga in Fidonet networking  

## Why This Matters
- **Preservation**: Keeps the Amiga relevant in the Fidonet ecosystem  
- **Community**: Provides sysops with a reliable mailer for Amiga systems  
- **Education**: Offers hands-on experience with FTN protocols and Amiga development  
- **Legacy**: Ensures the Amiga continues to connect and communicate in the networks it helped pioneer  

## Call to Action
We are inviting **Amiga programmers, sysops, and retro computing enthusiasts** to:
- Review the source files and submit patches or corrections  
- Clean up ANSI prototypes and resolve compiler warnings  
- Update socket handling for modern TCP/IP stacks  
- Share build notes, compiler flags, and environment setups  
- Test AmiBinkD in real Amiga environments and report issues  
- Help document quirks and fixes for future maintainers  

## How to Contribute
1. Fork this repository  
2. Review and improve the source code  
3. Submit pull requests with detailed notes on changes  
4. Share your build/test results in Issues or Discussions  

## Community
This project is a collaborative effort to keep the Amiga alive in Fidonet. Every contribution — big or small — helps ensure that AmiBinkD remains usable, teachable, and future-proof for the next generation of sysops.
